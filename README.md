## About The Project

![](preview\admin dash board home page.png)

A Frontend project to create a modern admin dashboard to visualize mock data and a theme setting sidebar to toggle between light and dark mode and different color themes using ReactJS, tailwind and syncfusion material UI library. I plan to explore javascripts library to help visualize data and this project was my first attempt. The frontend project has 4 mini-apps intergrated using components from syncfusion, Calender App, Kanban App, Editor, and Color-Picker. This is a work in progress and much more functionality can be included, ideally I would like to connect a backend to this application to make the data more dynamic.
